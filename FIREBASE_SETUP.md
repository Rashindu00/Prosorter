# Firebase Rules Configuration

## Current Status
✅ **Fixed**: Firebase indexing errors resolved by modifying query logic
✅ **Working**: All activities and dashboard features functional

## Firebase Rules Setup (Optional)

If you want to use the proper Firebase indexing for better performance, you can apply these rules to your Firebase Realtime Database:

### How to Apply Rules:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `prosorter-c2a36`
3. Navigate to **Realtime Database** → **Rules**
4. Copy the contents from `firebase-rules.json` file
5. Paste into the rules editor
6. Click **Publish**

### Rules Benefits:
- **Better Performance**: Indexed queries are faster
- **Enhanced Security**: Proper read/write permissions
- **Scalability**: Optimized for larger datasets

### Current Implementation:
- **Temporary Fix**: Removed `orderByChild()` queries to avoid indexing requirements
- **Client-Side Sorting**: Activities are now sorted in the application code
- **No Performance Impact**: Works well for current data size

### If You Apply Firebase Rules:
After applying the rules, you can revert to the optimized Firebase queries by changing:

```javascript
// Current implementation (works without rules)
const activitiesRef = ref(database, 'activities');

// Can be changed back to (requires Firebase rules)
const activitiesRef = query(ref(database, 'activities'), orderByChild('timestamp'), limitToLast(10));
```

## Notes:
- Current implementation works perfectly without any rule changes
- Firebase rules are only needed for production optimization
- All errors are resolved and application is fully functional
